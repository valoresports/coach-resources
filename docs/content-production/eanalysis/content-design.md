# Content Design: EAnalysis

## What is EAnalysis?
EAnalysis aims to break down manoeuvres, executions, strategies, etc. from professional esports games in relation to an individual skill from the gaming title's skill tree. A professional coach walks through a highlight (or lowlight) play by play to discuss what is technically at play and why the overall moment works for (or against) a team.

## Scope
| Attribute       | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LENGTH**      | At maximum, an EAnalysis should be scoped to a **single round/goal/point**. In terms of end result time limit, the maximum duration of an EAnalysis is **five (5) minutes**.<br/><br/>Coaches can reference a moment from another round/point in the match (e.g. to show the origins of an idea/strategy/tactic). However, as previously mentioned the EAnalysis itself is scoped to a single round/point. |
| **PLAYER(S)**   | There is **no maximum** number of players EAnalysis can focus on. It is *preferred* that EAnalysis focuses on only one (1) player, although team plays are also important to break down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **SKILL(S)**    | At **minimum**, one (1) 'focus' skill from the skill tree.<br/><br/>At **maximum**, one (1) 'focus' skill and an extra two (2) 'extra' skills from the skill tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **DEMO/REPLAY** | The situation being analysed must have a demo/replay file available. This will be uploaded to the platform and players will have an opportunity to do self-guided EAnalysis at their own pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **PURPOSE**     | There are two (2) types of EAnalysis: `HIGHLIGHT` and `LOWLIGHT`.<br/><br/>EAnalysis does **not** have to be based on success. There is also value in analysing a failure/defeat and applying those learnings to one's own journey.                                                                                                                                                                        |
