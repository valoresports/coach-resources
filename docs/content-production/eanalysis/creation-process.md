# Creation Process: EAnalysis

EAnalysis is a **fixed-price** deliverable. As at 2 April 2023, the price per EAnalysis delivered is USD 45.

## Summary
1. The coach selects an example from a professional game.
1. The coach notes down which skills are being focused on in this EAnalysis. In other words, one (1) 'focus' skill, and optionally two (2) 'extra' skills touched on by this EAnalysis.
1. For the 'focus' skill identified, the coach answers the following questions:
    1. What advantage/edge or disadvantage does the skill provide in this situation?
    1. How is the skill executed specifically by the player(s) in this situation? (Note: this is **not** how the skill is *generally* executed.)
    1. How does the utilisation of the skill turn the round/goal/point in favour of (or against) the player(s)?
1. What are some possible outcomes if the skill had not been utilised, or if it had been utilised wrongly?
1. For each of the 'extra' skills identified (if any), the coach answers the following questions:
    1. How does the use of the 'extra' skill complement the 'focus' skill?
    1. What are some possible outcomes if the 'extra' skill was not utilised?
1. The coach summarises:
    1. how the 'focus' skill turned the round/goal/point in favour of (or against) the player(s);
    1. how each 'extra' skill worked in tandem with (or against) the 'focus' skill; and
    1. how players can apply this knowledge to their own development and matches.

## Further instructions

There are **five (5)** steps to the EAnalysis creation process, which are detailed below.

### Stage 1: Plan

After selecting the round/goal/point and skill(s) which your EAnalysis will apply to, you should:

1. [Sign in](https://app.valoresports.com/sign-in) to the Valor platform.
1. Head to the [EAnalysis planning board](https://app.valoresports.com/content-creation/E_ANALYSIS/prepare/list).

:::important
Don't forget to write your answers as if you would say them out loud, and don't forget to plan your recordings. **If you forget to do these things your EAnalysis _will_ be sent back for re-doing**.
:::

### Stage 2: Plan Review

Valor will review your EAnalysis plan. If changes are needed Valor will reach out, otherwise once the EAnalysis is approved it will move to the next phase in the Valor platform.

### Stage 3: Record

:::warning
**Canva requires voiceover clips to be audio files, not video files**. For this reason we recommend recording your VO with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). If you record your VO using OBS, make sure to convert it to an audio-only file (e.g. mp3) before uploading to Canva.
:::

In this phase, you should:

1. Follow your recording plan to gather all the clips you need.
1. Record your voiceover from the script in the Valor platform and export the VO to an audio file.
1. Utilise a video editing program (or online tool such as [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)).
1. Drop footage clips and voiceover file into your editing software.
1. Once everything is assembled, export/download from your video editing software to an MP4 file.
1. Upload your EAnalysis to the [_Valor Esports Content Library_ YouTube channel](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCuBq5lmGJjSH0Hi7H3vwA3w).
1. Paste the link to the YouTube video into the Valor platform, **remembering to use the "embed" URL**.

### Stage 4: Recording Review

Valor will review your EAnalysis. If changes are needed Valor will reach out, otherwise once the EAnalysis is approved it will move to the final phase (Publication) in the Valor platform.

### Stage 5: Publication

The EAnalysis can now be published. This can be done by either Valor or yourself, so if you see a piece of content in "Publication" then feel free to push the green _Publish_ button yourself!
