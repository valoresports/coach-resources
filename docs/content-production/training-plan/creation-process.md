# Creation Process: Training Plan

Training Plan is **not** a fixed-price deliverable. That means you manually record the amount of time it takes you to make one in your timesheet.

## Creation instructions

There are **three (3)** steps to the Training Plan creation process, which are detailed below.

### Stage 1: Plan

After brainstorming the basic idea for your Training Plan, you should:

1. [Sign in](https://app.valoresports.com/sign-in) to the Valor platform.
1. Head to the [Training Plan planning board](https://app.valoresports.com/content-creation/TRAINING_PLAN/prepare/list).
1. Begin creating your Training Plan, following [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/gaYQB5UhRlE) if help is needed.

### Stage 2: Plan Review

Valor will review your Training Plan. If changes are needed Valor will reach out, otherwise once the Training Plan is approved it will move to the next phase in the Valor platform.

### Stage 3: Publication

The Training Plan can now be published. This can be done by either Valor or yourself, so if you see a piece of content in "Publication" then feel free to push the green _Publish_ button yourself!
