# EDrill Process

There are **five (5)** steps to the EDrill creation process.

## Stage 1: Plan
1. The coach ensures the skill being addressed has an [Esports Science Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yS3qaKe2preUy3wI6g4o7yYpZe72xWcQ3U8jgGiRttI/edit) completed.
1. The coach completes the [EDrill Planning Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zy8KCND1AkUxRaL7SAjWHxFyKP6ZAjsLp5uYvvftQZ0/edit).

## Stage 2: Plan Review
1. Valor reviews the coach's planning sheet.
<details>
    <summary><b>Review questions</b> &ndash; answer should always be <u>YES</u></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>In GQ1, is the title less than 40 characters?</li>
        <li>In GQ2, Is the fictional student testimonial realistic and believable?</li>
        <li>Have both minimum (GQ3) and maximum (GQ4) student numbers been filled in?</li>
        <li>In SC2, is the exercise explained without any steps being detailed?</li>
        <li>In SC3, does the answer explain why the repeatable action will improve players' performance in the relevant skills?</li>
        <li>In SC4, does the answer explain why the skills themselves are relevant to improving overall in-game?</li>
        <li>In SC4, is there an in-game example given which highlights the relevance of the skills?</li>
        <li>In SC5, is the prerequisite knowledge clearly explained?</li>
        <li>In SC6, does the answer (if any) explain pre-drill steps clearly?</li>
        <li>In SC7, are the drill steps broken down clearly?</li>
        <li>In SC8, does the answer (if any) explain pre-drill steps clearly?</li>
        <li>In SC10, is the goal completed for all six (6) levels?</li>
    </ul>
</details>

## Stage 3: Record
1. The coach gets set up with the [Valor OBS Templates](https://valoresports.github.io/coach-resources/docs/content-production/eworkouts/eworkouts-obs-scene-collection/) the same way they previously would for EWorkout production.
1. The coach ensures the EDrill title is set at the top of the OBS scene.
1. The coach hits record and proceeds to introduce themselves and read their answers to the questions in the "Script Creation" section of their EDrill Planning Sheet.
1. The coach uploads the finished EDrill as a single video file to their "Coaches Corner" folder in Valor Google Drive.

## Stage 4: Recording Review
1. Valor reviews the coach's video file delivery.
<details>
    <summary><b>Review questions</b> &ndash; answer should always be <u>YES</u></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the file size under 300 megabytes?</li>
        <li>Did the coach use the <a href="https://valoresports.github.io/coach-resources/docs/content-production/eworkouts/eworkouts-obs-scene-collection/">Valor OBS Templates</a>?</li>
        <li>Is the EDrill contained in one video file (including audio too)?</li>
        <li>Is the EDrill video of a high resolution (ie. at least 1920x1080)?</li>
        <li>Is the title from the planning sheet the same as in the EDrill video?</li>
        <li>Are there any "open" moments where it feels like the video is too long or has sections which are not useful/productive?</li>
        <li>Is the coach's voice very audible over the game audio?</li>
        <li>Is the EDrill video less than 3 minutes 30 seconds?</li>
        <li>Does the coach's speech in the EDrill video substantially match their answers to the questions in the "Script Creation" section of their planning sheet?</li>
        <li>Does the coach speak smoothly and clearly throughout the EDrill video?</li>
        <li>Does what is shown on-screen in the EDrill video match what the coach is talking about at all times?</li>
    </ul>
</details>
1. Valor answers any game-specific questions. **These are still to come**, and will be used in the *EDrill Round 2* project.
1. Valor comments openly on anything that may require improvement.

## Stage 5: Publication
1. Valor publishes the coach's EDrill to the database.
