# EDrill Process

EDrills are a **fixed-price** deliverable. As at 28 February 2023, the price per EDrill delivered is USD 40.

There are **five (5)** steps to the EDrill creation process, which are detailed below.

## Stage 1: Plan

After selecting the skill which the EDrill will apply to, you should:

1. Sign in to the Valor platform: https://app.valoresports.com/sign-in
2. Head to the EDrill "Kanban" Board: https://app.valoresports.com/content-creation/E_DRILL/prepare/list

:::important
Don't forget to write your answers as if you would say them out loud, and don't forget to plan your recordings. **If you forget to do these things your EDrill will be sent back for re-doing**.

## Stage 2: Plan Review

Valor will review your EDrill plan. If changes are needed Valor will reach out, otherwise once the EDrill is approved it will move to the next phase in the Valor platform.

## Stage 3: Record

In this phase, you should:

1. Follow your recording plan to gather all the clips you need
2. Record your voiceover from the script in the Valor platform and export the VO to an audio file
3. Utilise a video editing program (or online tool such as [Canva](https://www.canva.com/))
4. Drop footage clips and voiceover file into your editing software
6. Once everything is assembled, export/download from your video editing software to an MP4 file
7. Upload your EDrill to the _Valor Esports Content Library_ YouTube channel: https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCuBq5lmGJjSH0Hi7H3vwA3w
8. Paste the link to the YouTube video into the Valor platform, **remembering to use the "embed" URL**

If you have trouble accessing the _Valor Esports Content Library_ YouTube channel, please let Nick know and he will arrange access for you ASAP.

## Stage 4: Recording Review

Valor will review your EDrill. If changes are needed Valor will reach out, otherwise once the EDrill is approved it will move to the final phase (Publication) in the Valor platform.

## Stage 5: Publication

The EDrill can now be published. This can be done by either Valor or yourself, so if you see a piece of content in "Publication" then feel free to push the green _Publish_ button yourself!
