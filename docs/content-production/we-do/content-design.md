# Content Design: We Do

## What is We Do?

We Do aims to assist players with the initial execution of a particular skill and/or the execution of an individual drill. Users watch a coach or professional player perform an EDrill and listen to them explain their thought process aloud during execution. This type of content allows people to either: (1) learn the basics of a skill by watching somebody who is proficient in it; or (2) understand how a specific drill should ideally be executed to maximise training value.

## Scope

| Attribute     | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **LENGTH**    | At maximum, a We Do should be scoped to a **single drill**. In terms of end result time limit, the maximum duration of a We Do is **ten (10) minutes**.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **PLAYER(S)** | There is no theoretical maximum number of players that can be part of a We Do, however in practice this is currently limited to **one (1) player**. As Valor works towards creating team EDrills, showing the execution and thought process of each player will be an important feature for users, however this is a bridge that will be crossed when we get there. |
| **SKILL(S)**  | It is _preferred_ that We Do content specifically focuses on the skill(s) being honed by the EDrill being shown. Passing references to other skills are fine, but using a drill for Skill A and then training and explicitly discussing Skill B in a We Do is not acceptable.                                                                                       |
