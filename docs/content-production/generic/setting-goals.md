# Setting Goals

## Fraction-based goals

_In other words: `x` out of `y`._

### `FRACTION`: Highest number

The goal is to get the **highest possible value**.

This is calculated by performing `x / y`, where `x` is the player's achievement and `y` is the goal (e.g. passes, headshots, goals, etc.)


### `FRACTION_INVERSE`: Lowest number

The goal is to get the **lowest possible value**.

This is calculated by performing `y / x`, where `x` is the player's achievement and `y` is the goal (e.g. crashes, seconds taken, etc.)
