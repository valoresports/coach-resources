# EWorkout Criteria

## Checklist / criteria points

**The answer to every question below should be yes.**

### EWorkout has a clear purpose

:::info

Each EWorkout should have a very clear purpose. Why are players drilling a certain skill? If the EWorkout practises multiple skills, why are they combined and in that order?

:::

- [ ] Does the EWorkout say what will be done?
- [ ] Does the EWorkout say why it will be done?
- [ ] Does the EWorkout say how it will be done?

### EDrills each have a clear purpose and address a narrow, specific skill

:::info

An EDrill should have a clear purpose (as above), and allow users to understand (at a basic level) and practise a specific skill. It should not cover a broad group of different skills. If a user needs to improve on multiple skills, there should be an EDrill for each of those skills.

:::

- [ ] Does the EDrill explain what will be done and why/how?
- [ ] Does the EDrill focus on a single skill?

### Ability to test users

:::info

EWorkouts should be able to test a user’s progress in the skill. There should be goals for 3 levels of achievement (low/beginner, medium/intermediate, high/advanced) which can be used to gauge user skill level and track improvement over time.

:::

- [ ] Are there 3 levels of goals?
- [ ] Are metrics assigned to each level?
- [ ] Is there a time limit for each goal?

### Highly structured

:::info

EWorkouts generally comprise two parts. In the first part, there is an introduction, warm-up, and the first ‘half’ of the exercises. The first half is followed by a break where players reflect upon what they have learned. After the break, the second half finishes off the EWorkout’s exercises and concludes by wrapping up the drills.

The structure above is not required to be followed, rather it serves as an example of a well-structured EWorkout. There is no issue with an EWorkout deviating from this ‘usual’ practice, however the end result should still feel balanced and well structured.

:::

- [ ] Are the sections (excluding breaks) of similar or equal intensity/length?
- [ ] Is there a break for stretching, drinking water, and reflecting on what has been learned?

### Evidence-based

:::info

EWorkouts should be well-researched before production. The methods used to ‘drill’ (practise) skills should be tried and true, or if they are newly developed (as esports ‘sport science’ is a new field) they should be documented.

:::

### Clear

:::info

EWorkouts should be easy to understand. Coaches should avoid using ambiguous language and unfamiliar terms. The easiest way to achieve this is to prepare a script or at least a list of key points during pre-production.

:::

### Efficient and concise

:::info

Concepts and exercises should be presented efficiently. Coaches should not be extending duration by rambling or saying ‘um’ or ‘uhh’ in a high-quality EWorkout. As above the easiest way to achieve this is to prepare a script or at least a list of key points during pre-production.

:::

- [ ] Is speech clear and concise?
- [ ] Does the presenter avoid hesitating during speech (eg. long pauses or “um”/”uhh”)?

### Consistent

:::info

Throughout an EWorkout, concepts should be explained in similar ways, and audio and microphone levels, webcam usage and quality, and game footage should overall be consistent.

:::

:::note

Long term it might be useful to have a sort of ‘best practice’ list for each game. To minimise confusion we could have standardised ways of referring to concepts/scenarios which have many different names, plus standardised ways of explaining certain situations.

:::

- [ ] Are footage and audio quality (and audio levels) consistent throughout?

### Emphasise warm-ups and breaks

:::info

Warming up properly and taking regular breaks are both key to approaching learning in a healthy way. EWorkouts should not treat warm-ups and breaks as throwaway things that are included in EWorkouts simply because Valor requires them. Instead, they should be emphasised and players (particularly young, impressionable ones) encouraged to do them.

:::

- [ ] Does the presenter emphasise the importance of breaks when training?

### High production quality

:::info

The Valor Content Production OBS Templates should be used when recording an EWorkout. Following the templates correctly will help to ensure the ‘highly structured’ criteria above is fulfilled.

:::

- [ ] Were the Valor OBS templates used?
