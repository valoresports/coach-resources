# Setting EDrill and EWorkout Goals

## Fraction-based goals

_In other words: `x` out of `y`._

This is calculated by performing `x / y`, where `x` is the player's achievement and `y` is the goal (eg. passes, headshots, goals, etc.)

Achievement levels:

This is calculated by performing `y / x`, where `x` is the player's achievement and `y` is the goal (eg. crashes, seconds taken, etc.)
