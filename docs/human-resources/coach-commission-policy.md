# Coach Commission Policy

Last updated: 4 October 2022

1. We are customer-obsessed and know that deivering the best possible experiences to everyone increases the likelihood of them converting a free trial into being a paid customer, or staying as a paid customer.

1. To encourage our coaches to provide high-quality experiences, we offer a commission as follows (subject to the clauses directly below):

   1. in the case of a new customer, converting from a free trial---ten per cent (10%) of the invoice amount (a **New Customer Commission**); and
   1. in the case of a repeat customer, who has been a paid customer before---five per cent (5%) of the invoice amount relating to the coach's game (a **Repeat Customer Commission**),

   both a **Commission** for the purposes of this policy.

1. Repeat Customer Commissions are scoped to the game. For example, if _Customer A_ re-signs and purchases 50 hours of Rocket League coaching and 30 hours of Valorant coaching, then Coach RL would receive 5% of the amount relating to Rocket League and Coach Val would receive 5% of the amount relating to Valorant.

1. Any calculations related to a Commission apply _after_ any discounts and exclusive of any added amounts relating to Valor's taxation liability (ie. sales tax).

1. A Commission becomes payable to the relevant coach **after** all of the following:
   1. the customer is issued with the relevant invoice; and
   1. the customer pays the relevant invoice in full.
