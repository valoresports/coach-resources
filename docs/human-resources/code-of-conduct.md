# Coach Code of Conduct

## General principles

We are **customer-obsessed** and want to make sure we deliver the best possible experiences to everyone. You should **always be polite and respectful** to all customers, <u>no matter the circumstances</u>.

We don't mind at all if you have external work, **so long as**:

1. your external work **does not** impact your Valor obligations; or
2. you **do not** take Valor clients/customers for your external work.

## Coaching sessions

You should **follow all checklists** for coaching sessions. For more information head to the [Live Coaching](../live-coaching/live-coaching.md) page.

If you do _not_ follow a checklist, we have a **two-strike policy**. Generally after two strikes we may need to let you go. We want to deliver the highest quality products and services and we do that by ensuring our coaches follow high standards of conduct.
