# Code of Conduct

Last updated: 18 March 2022

1. We are customer-obsessed and want to make sure we deliver the best possible experiences to everyone.

1. You may undertake external work, so long as:

   - your external work does not impact your Valor obligations; and
   - you do not poach Valor clients/customers for your external work.

1. When running live coaching sessions, ensure you always follow the [coaching session requirements](../live-coaching/checklists/live-coaching-session-requirements.md).

1. Do not engage in **any** unobserved one-on-one activity with players, regardless of age. This includes private messages on Discord. Only talk to players through the public channels in our Discord server.

   - NOTE: If a player reaches out to you personally with a serious issue (for example, mental health concerns), please talk to the Valor Admin team. We have strong and confidential processes in place to assist all players.

1. If you fail to attend a live coaching session, we have a three-strike policy. If you fail to attend three (3) live coaching sessions within a three-month period, you will be suspended from coaching live sessions. We will find a new coach for your teams and find other ways to work with you.

1. If you are ten (10) or more minutes late to a live coaching session, this counts as not attending the session.

1. We do not tolerate harmful or abusive behaviours. As a coach, you also should not tolerate harmful or abusive behaviours from players.

1. Adopt responsible behaviour in relation to alcohol and other drugs. It goes without saying that you should not attend a meeting or a live coaching session when under the influence of drugs.

1. Ensure your decisions and actions contribute to a harassment-free environment at all times.
