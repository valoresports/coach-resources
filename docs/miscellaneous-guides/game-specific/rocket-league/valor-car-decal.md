## Add the Valor car decal to your game

1. Start your game and press F5.
2. Go to the "Cosmetics" tab at the top.
3. Find the section called "Decal Texture Mods" and press "Open Directory". A folder called "Decal Textures" should open on your PC.
4. Unzip the ZIP file you were sent, which contains the Valor decal, and copy all of its contents to the "Decal Textures" folder.
5. Restart your game.
6. Repeat steps 2â€“3 above
7. In the "Decal Texture Mods" section, you can now select the Valor decal.
8. Press F2 to open BakkesMod. Go to the "Items" tab and select the "Octane:Wings" decal.
9. The texture should work now. If for any reason you don't like the custom engine texture, you can just remove that file from the folder in step 4.

<br />

_The reason you have to select the Wings decal, is because you should be able to display your car normally in matches. AlphaConsole is only local (like when using BakkesMod for items) and therefore others can't see your custom texture. Normally AlphaConsole replaces your normal skin (if you have no decal on) with this decal, however then you cannot customize your car (since you can't select "no decal" with BakkesMod). This way, you can still customize your car in whatever way you want, but it will have the custom texture._
