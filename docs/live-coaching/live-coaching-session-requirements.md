# Coaching Session Requirements

Last updated: 18 March 2022

## Non-Negotiables

- [ ] Check in with the team thirty (30) minutes before the session begins. We will accept as late as 15 minutes before the session, but do not be consistently late checking in. State how many minutes until the session begins (e.g. 25 minutes until session = "Hey guys, session in 25 mins. See you soon!").

- [ ] Follow the typical Valor session structure (if you are unsure, please talk to the Valor Admin Team as soon as possible).

- [ ] Record the session.

- [ ] Publish the session. [If you don't know how to do this, there is a tutorial here](./publishing-recorded-sessions.md).

- [ ] Update your team's reporting spreadsheet as required.

## Bonus Criteria

- [ ] Everything listed above under "Non-Negotiables" above.

- [ ] Prepare all relevant templates before the session.
