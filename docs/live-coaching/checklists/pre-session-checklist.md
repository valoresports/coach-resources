- Make sure you have the players' ranks ([more info](#ensure-you-have-ranks))

## Say hello

:::note To do

Introduce yourself to the team

:::

Make sure the players know who you are and are excited to start learning with you.

## Ensure you have ranks

:::note To do

Make sure you have the players' ranks

:::

At the moment these are manually provided to you by Valor's Support Staff. If you haven't received this information before you start your session, please reach out to the Support Staff.

## Receive and review gameplay videos

:::note To do

Ask for gameplay recordings and review them

:::

Reviewing your players' gameplay videos will help you understand where they are at in terms of skill level, moreso than just seeing their in-game rank. They may show promising skill in some areas but not others, and you will know what to work on in the session.

## Know your lesson plan

:::note To do

Know what lesson plan you will be using

:::

Plan your lesson according to the players' ranks and gameplay videos you have reviewed. Your first session may not be perfect, but by planning well you can make it as good as can be. After your first session, you can make tweaks and improve.

## Test recording setup

:::note To do

Ensure recording setup works

:::

You need to ensure that OBS is set up correctly to record your session. If you need assistance with this, we can walk you through. We are currently working on a guide.
