# Coaching Session Requirements

Last updated: 18 March 2022

## Non-Negotiables

- [ ] Check in with the team 30 minutes before the session begins. We will accept as late as 15 minutes before the session, but do not be consistently late checking in. Say how many minutes until the session begins (ie. 25 minutes until session = "Hey guys, session in 25 mins. See you soon!").

- [ ] Record the session.

- [ ] Publish the session. [If you don't know how to do this, there is a tutorial here](../publishing-recorded-sessions.md).

- [ ] Update your team's reporting spreadsheet as required.

## Bonus Criteria

- [ ] Everything listed above under "Non-Negotiable".

- [ ] Prepare all relevant templates before the session.
